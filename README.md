# Version features

- Fixed bug if you type a artist name in a search fild. Now you are geting a bio.
- Solved:  How add into object new paar key\varible if key it's a value of another varible

# To-do

- add opportunity to upload db if you reach "bio" via movie reguest;
- add cheker db for bio via "bio" via movie reguest;
- create a structure, when we can use the same "request" function;
- describe logick;

# Question to Buelent

- the idea was create module structure, and call function otside (on page) wiht atribute which is also function. It's not working.

  - onclick from button
  - varible as container for .value

- Why if variable declared outside from function we couldn't get a value? (dbHandler, line:13 )
